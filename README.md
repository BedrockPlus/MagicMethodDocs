## What is Magic Method?
Magic Method is a method created by [Chainsketch](https://www.youtube.com/@Chainsketch) that allows you to access anything in the game. This allows you to make many mods, as magic method can interact with other players, item data, and UI.

## Pros/Cons of Magic Method
✅ Pros:
 - You can access data from almost anywhere.
 - It is relatively easy to setup once you know what you are doing.
 - It is compatible with any texture pack so you can add it.
 - It isn't experimental like public variables.
 
❌ Cons:
 - Sometimes it breaks on specific servers.
 - It is difficult to learn.
 - It will spontaneously break without much warning.

## To understand Magic Method....
To understand Magic Method you have to know about the different storage types. Most often you will see ```variable``` being used but other things like ```temp``` and ```context``` exist. For magic method you need to use ```temp```, as it directly writes to the game's storage.
